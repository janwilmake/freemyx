TODO

- Fix current redirect bug. identify issue, ensure that never happens (maybe need basic plan, but may be able to do this infinite in different way)
- Add scientists as group
- Come up with the minimal flow for a third party app to leverage this without oauth provider. there's no data here so no need, they could just use my oauth and ensure there's a proper redirect and message before X OAuth.
- Make form more fine-grained. public domain is FULLY LIBERATED.
- After approval show ways to help
  - tweet with `#freemyx`
  - donate to support the 'data liberation movement'
- `og:image` to show who liberated
- Get back to feedback in `#data-policy`.
