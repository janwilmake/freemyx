- ✅ Fix current redirect bug. identify issue, ensure that never happens (maybe need basic plan, but may be able to do this infinite in different way)
- ✅ Add scientists as group. Make form more fine-grained. Public domain is FULLY LIBERATED. Can't do anything with controlled data provision for now
- Come up with the minimal flow for a third party app to leverage this without oauth provider. there's no data here so no need, they could just use my oauth and ensure there's a proper redirect and message before X OAuth.
- ✅ After approval show ways to help
  - ✅ tweet with `#freemyx`
  - ✅ donate to support the 'data liberation movement'
