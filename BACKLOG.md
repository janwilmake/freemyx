- make this an oauth provider (developers can login and create clients to get permission to exisiting synced data). people that made their data public domain will be redirected back instantly (superior to x oauth)
- after approval see what people you follow did (need data for this)

Having tried the oauth provider, it seems quite a headache but may be worth anyways.
