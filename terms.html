                                about access to your public X data. Your vote determines which OAuth scopes you
                                authorize and how third-party applications may access your information. Once you vote
                                and data is accessed according to your preferences, it may be stored permanently and
                                used in ways you cannot control. Only participate if you fully understand and accept the
                                democratic consequences of your vote.</strong>
